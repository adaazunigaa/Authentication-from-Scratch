AUTHENTICATION
    What is it?
        The process of verifying who a particular user is.
        We tipically authenticate whith a username/password combo, but we can also use 
        security question, facial recognition, etc.

AUTHORIZATION
    What is it?
        verifying what a specific user has access to.
        Generally, we authorize after a user has been authenticated. -"Now tha we know you 
        are here, here is what you are allowed to do and NOT allowed to do".


RULE #1
NEVER STORE PASSWORDS


HASING 
    Rather than storing a password in the database, we run the password through a hashing 
    function first and then store the result in the database.
    Hasahing functions are functions that map input data of some arbritary size to 
    fixed-size output values.
